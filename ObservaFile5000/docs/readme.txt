Home Coding Exercise
You may use C#, VB, or Java to implement the project. Zip up your implementation sources into a single file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
In this exercise you will create a command-line program to watch for text files to be created or modified in a directory and then output information about them.
•	The program takes 2 arguments, the directory to watch and a file pattern, example: program.exe "c:\file folder" *.txt
•	The path may be an absolute path, relative to the current directory, or UNC.
•	Use the modified date of the file as a trigger that the file has changed.
•	Check for changes every 10 seconds.
•	When a file is created output a line to the console with its name and how many lines are in it.
•	When a file is modified output a line with its name and the change in number of lines (use a + or - to indicate more or less).
•	When a file is deleted output a line with its name.
•	Files will be ASCII or UTF-8 and will use Windows line separators (CR LF).
•	Multiple files may be changed at the same time, can be up to 2 GB in size, and may be locked for several seconds at a time.
•	Use multiple threads so that the program doesn't block on a single large or locked file.
•	Program will be run on Windows 10.
•	File names are case insensitive.
